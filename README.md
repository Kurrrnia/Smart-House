* SmartHouse Project

This project is a simple Smart House system combining three main automation features into one microcontroller setup:

* Smart Access Gate (RFID)
- Uses RFID to allow secure access to the home.
- Only registered RFID tags can open the gate.

* Automatic Clothes Dryer
- A smart drying rack system that automatically retracts when it rains and extends in sunny conditions.
- Uses rain and light sensors to detect weather.

* Automatic Lighting
- Lights turn on automatically when motion is detected in low-light conditions.
- Helps save energy by turning off when no motion is detected.
